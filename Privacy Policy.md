## Encuesta: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Encuesta app for Android!

This is an closed source Android app developed by Ruben Hernandez.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have programmed this app to only **collect Location information** as personally identifiable information. 

The purpose of this app is to record interviews in the form of surveys in different geografical locations that must be recorded, validated and auditable to ensure the research is accurate and reflects metrics in a predefined location.

The app will remain fully functional even if the user decides not to allow **Location information** to be collected.

The app will also connect to the **Internet** and send all data collected from surveys and location to me. If the user does not want this data to be sent, do not enable wifi nor cell data while using the app and simply erase it by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.


### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app is as follows:

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.INTERNET` | This is required to transmit the data collected. |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` and `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | The only sensitive permission that the app requests, and can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. Required to collect location of device while surveying. |
| `android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE` | Enables the app to create foreground services that will collect location and display media files while the app is in use. Permission automatically granted by the system; can't be revoked by user. |
